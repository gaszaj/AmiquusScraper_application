          <strong>What Amiquus is (and is not).</strong> Amiquus provides
          software tools such as search, notifications, filtering, organization,
          and links that help you discover and track vehicle listings on
          third-party websites. Amiquus is <strong>not</strong> a car dealer,
          broker, marketplace, auctioneer, insurer, lender, or a party to any
          transaction between you and a third party. Any purchase, negotiation,
          or interaction related to a vehicle is solely between you and the
          relevant third party.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2>1. Agreement to Terms</h2>
      <p>
        These Terms of Service (“Terms”) are a legally binding agreement between
        you (“you” or “User”) and Amiquus (“Amiquus,” “we,” “us,” or “our”)
        governing your access to and use of our website, applications, and
        services (collectively, the “Service”).
      </p>
      <p>
        By accessing or using the Service, you acknowledge that you have read,
        understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms and by any policies
        referenced here (including the Refund Policy and Privacy Policy). If you
        do not agree, do not use the Service.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Eligibility and Account Registration</h2>
      <p>
        You must be at least 18 years old (or the age of majority in your
        jurisdiction) to use the Service.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you create an account, you agree to provide accurate, complete, and
        up-to-date information and to keep it current. You are responsible for
        maintaining the confidentiality of your credentials and for all activity
        that occurs under your account.
      </p>
      <p>
        You must promptly notify us of any suspected unauthorized access or
        security incident at
        <a href="mailto:support@amiquus.com">support@amiquus.com</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Service Description; Third-Party Websites</h2>
      <p>
        The Service may display, transform, organize, summarize, or otherwise
        present information about vehicle listings that originate from
        third-party websites (“Listing Sites”) and may provide deep links that
        take you to those Listing Sites.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Listing Sites are independent third parties.</strong> We do not
        control, operate, endorse, or guarantee any Listing Site, including the
        accuracy, availability, legality, or completeness of information shown
        on a Listing Site, or the quality, safety, or legitimacy of any vehicles
        or offers.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Information may change at any time.</strong> Listing details
        (including price, availability, mileage, options, seller identity, and
        other attributes) can change without notice, and the way Listing Sites
        display or allow access to information can change due to their own
        policies, technical changes, or availability. You agree that you will
        always verify any listing details directly on the Listing Site and with
        the seller before making decisions.
      </p>

      <h2>4. User Responsibility; No Reliance</h2>
      <p>
        You acknowledge that the Service is provided for informational and
        convenience purposes only. You are solely responsible for how you
        interpret, use, or act on any information accessed through the Service,
        including contacting sellers, negotiating, purchasing, transporting,
        financing, inspecting, or registering a vehicle.
      </p>
      <p>
        You should use appropriate professional advice where needed (e.g.,
        mechanical inspection, legal guidance, financing advice) and perform
        your own due diligence. Amiquus is not responsible for your decisions or
        outcomes.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Prohibited Use</h2>
      <p>
        You agree not to misuse the Service. Misuse includes: attempting to gain
        unauthorized access to the Service or systems; interfering with or
        disrupting the Service; reverse engineering except where prohibited by
        law; using the Service to violate any law or the rights of others;
        uploading malware; or using the Service in a manner that imposes an
        unreasonable burden on the Service or our providers.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Subscriptions, Billing, and Taxes</h2>
      <p>
        Certain features require a paid subscription. By starting a
        subscription, you authorize us (and our payment processor) to charge
        your payment method on a recurring basis according to the plan you
        select until you cancel.
      </p>
      <p>
        All fees are exclusive of taxes, and applicable taxes may be added where
        required. Prices may change; if we make a material price change, we will
        provide advance notice before it takes effect for your next billing
        cycle.
      </p>
      <p>
        Payments are processed by third-party payment processors (for example,
        Stripe). We do not store full payment card details; payment information
        is handled by the processor under its terms.
        :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
      </p>

      <h2>7. Cancellation</h2>
      <p>
        You can cancel your subscription at any time through your account
        settings (if available) or by contacting us. Cancellation stops future
        renewals. Unless required by law or expressly stated in our Refund
        Policy, cancellation does not entitle you to a refund or credits for any
        fees already paid.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Refunds</h2>
      <p>
        Refunds, if any, are governed exclusively by our Refund Policy. If there
        is any conflict between these Terms and the Refund Policy, the Refund
        Policy controls for refund-related issues.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Capacity Limits; Waitlist</h2>
      <p>
        To maintain service quality, we may limit active subscriptions (for
        example, to a maximum number of active subscribers at a given time). If
        capacity is reached, we may offer a waitlist and notify users as space
        becomes available. We may adjust capacity limits at any time.
      </p>

      <h2>10. Intellectual Property</h2>
      <p>
        The Service, including its software, design, text, graphics, and all
        related intellectual property rights, is owned by Amiquus or its
        licensors and is protected by applicable laws. Subject to your
        compliance with these Terms, Amiquus grants you a limited,
        non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to access and use the
        Service for your personal or internal business purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Amiquus trademarks, logos, and trade dress may not be used without our
        prior written consent.
      </p>

      <h2>11. Feedback</h2>
      <p>
        If you provide feedback or suggestions, you grant us the right to use
        them without restriction or compensation to you.
      </p>

      <h2>12. Termination and Suspension</h2>
      <p>
        We may suspend or terminate your access to the Service at any time, with
        or without notice, if we believe you violated these Terms, created risk,
        or used the Service in a way that could expose us, other users, or third
        parties to liability.
      </p>
      <p>
        Upon termination, your right to use the Service stops immediately.
        Sections intended to survive termination (including limitation of
        liability, disclaimers, governing law, and indemnity) will survive.
      </p>

      <h2>13. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
      <p>
        THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS. TO THE
        MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, AMIQUUS DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES,
        EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
        FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
      </p>
      <p>
        WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE,
        ERROR-FREE, OR THAT ANY OUTPUT OR INFORMATION WILL BE ACCURATE,
        COMPLETE, OR CURRENT. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT LISTING SITES OR THEIR
        CONTENT WILL BE AVAILABLE OR COMPATIBLE WITH THE SERVICE.
      </p>

      <h2>14. Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>
        TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL AMIQUUS OR ITS
        AFFILIATES, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, CONTRACTORS, OR AGENTS BE LIABLE FOR
        ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE
        DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA, GOODWILL, OR OTHER
        INTANGIBLE LOSSES, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO YOUR USE OF (OR
        INABILITY TO USE) THE SERVICE.
      </p>
      <p>
        TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, AMIQUUS’S TOTAL LIABILITY FOR
        ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE SERVICE OR THESE TERMS WILL
        NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU PAID TO AMIQUUS FOR THE SERVICE IN THE THREE
        (3) MONTHS BEFORE THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM.
      </p>

      <h2>15. Indemnification</h2>
      <p>
        You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Amiquus and its
        affiliates, directors, employees, and agents from and against any
        claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable
        attorneys’ fees) arising out of or related to: (a) your use of the
        Service, (b) your violation of these Terms, (c) your violation of any
        law or the rights of a third party, or (d) any dispute between you and a
        Listing Site, seller, or other third party.
      </p>

      <h2>16. Changes to the Service and Terms</h2>
      <p>
        We may modify or discontinue the Service (in whole or in part) at any
        time. We may update these Terms from time to time. If we make a material
        change, we will make reasonable efforts to provide notice (for example,
        by posting an updated date and/or sending an email).
      </p>
      <p>
        Your continued use of the Service after updated Terms become effective
        constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.
      </p>

      <h2>17. EU/EEA/UK Consumer Rights (If Applicable)</h2>
      <p>
        If you are a consumer in the EU/EEA/UK, you may have mandatory rights
        that cannot be waived by contract, including withdrawal rights for
        distance contracts. Nothing in these Terms limits those mandatory
        rights.
      </p>
      <p>
        Where allowed by law for digital services, if you request immediate
        access/performance during the withdrawal period, you may be asked to
        expressly consent to that immediate performance and acknowledge that you
        may lose your right of withdrawal once performance begins.
      </p>

      <h2>18. Severability; Entire Agreement; Assignment</h2>
      <p>
        If any provision of these Terms is found invalid or unenforceable, the
        remaining provisions remain in effect. These Terms and the policies
        referenced herein constitute the entire agreement between you and
        Amiquus regarding the Service.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may not assign these Terms without our prior written consent. We may
        assign these Terms in connection with a merger, acquisition,
        reorganization, or sale of assets.
      </p>
