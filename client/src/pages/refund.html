      <div class="callout">
        <p>
          <strong>Summary.</strong> Subscription payments are generally
          non-refundable. You can cancel at any time to prevent future renewals.
          We offer a narrow refund window for the most recent payment if
          requested within 24 hours, subject to the conditions below and unless
          the law requires otherwise.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2>1. General Rule: No Refunds</h2>
      <p>
        Unless required by applicable law, all fees and charges for
        subscriptions are non-refundable and non-creditable once paid.
        Cancelling your subscription stops future renewals but does not
        automatically refund amounts already paid.
      </p>

      <h2>2. 24-Hour Refund Exception (Most Recent Payment Only)</h2>
      <p>
        We may, at our discretion, refund your
        <strong>most recent subscription payment</strong> if you meet
        <em>all</em> of the following conditions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          You submit a refund request within <strong>24 hours</strong> of the
          time of the charge.
        </li>
        <li>
          You <strong>cancel</strong> your subscription before or at the time
          you request the refund (to prevent a new renewal).
        </li>
        <li>
          You email your request to
          <a href="mailto:refunds@amiquus.com">refunds@amiquus.com</a> from the
          email address associated with your Amiquus account.
        </li>
        <li>
          You include: (a) your account email, (b) the plan name, and (c) the
          date/time of the charge (approximate is fine).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If approved, the refund applies only to the
        <strong>last successful payment</strong>. Earlier payments are not
        eligible. Refunds are processed back to the original payment method
        where possible.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Non-Eligible Situations</h2>
      <p>
        To the maximum extent permitted by law, we do not provide refunds for:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Requests submitted more than 24 hours after the charge time.</li>
        <li>Partial periods of use, unused time, or plan downgrades.</li>
        <li>
          Account termination or suspension for violation of our Terms of
          Service.
        </li>
        <li>
          Issues caused by third-party websites, third-party content, or changes
          outside our control.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Chargebacks and Payment Disputes</h2>
      <p>
        If you have a billing issue, please contact us first at
        <a href="mailto:refunds@amiquus.com">refunds@amiquus.com</a>. Unresolved
        chargebacks or payment disputes may result in immediate suspension or
        termination of your account.
      </p>

      <h2>5. EU/EEA/UK Consumer Notice (If Applicable)</h2>
      <p>
        If you are a consumer in the EU/EEA/UK, you may have a statutory right
        to withdraw from a distance contract within 14 days, unless an exception
        applies. Nothing in this Refund Policy limits mandatory consumer rights.
        :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}
      </p>
      <p>
        For digital services, where permitted, you may be asked to expressly
        request immediate performance and acknowledge that you may lose your
        withdrawal right once performance begins.
