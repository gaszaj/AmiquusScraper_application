            <p>
              Welcome to Amiquus ("Company", "we", "our", "us")! These Terms of Service ("Terms", "Terms of Service") govern your use of our website located at amiquus.com (together or individually "Service") operated by Amiquus.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our Privacy Policy also governs your use of our Service and explains how we collect, safeguard and disclose information that results from your use of our web pages. Please read it here: <a href="/privacy" className="text-primary-600 hover:underline">Privacy Policy</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              By using our Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms and our Privacy Policy. If you disagree with any part of these terms, then you may not access the Service.
            </p>
            
            <h2>2. Communications</h2>
            <p>
              By creating an Account on our Service, you agree to subscribe to newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information we may send. However, you may opt out of receiving any, or all, of these communications from us by following the unsubscribe link or instructions provided in any email we send.
            </p>
            
            <h2>3. Subscriptions</h2>
            <p>
              Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis. You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis, depending on the type of subscription plan you select. Billing cycles are set on a monthly or annual basis.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the end of each billing period, your subscription will automatically renew under the same conditions unless you cancel it or Amiquus cancels it. You may cancel your subscription renewal either through your online account or by contacting our customer support team.
            </p>
            <p>
              A valid payment method, including credit card, is required to process the payment for your subscription. You shall provide Amiquus with accurate and complete billing information, including full name, address, state, zip code, and valid payment method information. By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize Amiquus to charge all subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.
            </p>
            <p>
              Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, Amiquus will issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full payment corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the invoice.
            </p>
            
            <h2>4. Free Trial</h2>
            <p>
              Amiquus may, at its sole discretion, offer a subscription with a free trial for a limited period of time.
            </p>
            <p>
              You may be required to enter your billing information to sign up for the free trial. If you do enter your billing information when signing up for a free trial, you will not be charged by Amiquus until the free trial has expired. On the last day of the free trial period, unless you canceled your subscription, you will be automatically charged the applicable subscription fee for the type of subscription you have selected.
            </p>
            <p>
              At any time and without notice, Amiquus reserves the right to (i) modify the terms and conditions of the free trial offer, or (ii) cancel such free trial offer.
